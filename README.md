# ALIGNER-INTRA-GPU

GPU-accelerated sequence-to-graph aligner based on partial order dynamic programming. This project implements exact alignment (no heuristics) between reads and reference graphs using CUDA, efficiently parallelizing both intra- and inter-sequence computations.

---

## 🧬 Overview

This tool computes the optimal alignment score between a sequence and a genomic variation graph, represented in CSR format. Results are optimal.

## 🔧 Build Instructions

To build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/necst/GPU-POA.git
cd GPU-POA
make
```

To clean the build:
```bash
make clean
```

## 🚀 Usage

### 🧪 Manual test with custom inputs

You can run the aligner directly on any input files using:

```bash
./poagpu <num_blocks> <reads_file.fa> <graph_file.gfa>
```

Arguments:
- `<graph_file.gfa>`: input graph in GFA format
- `<reads_file.fa>`: input reads in FASTA format
- `<num_blocks>`: number of CUDA blocks to use

This command allows you to test the aligner with any graph and read set of your choice.

### ⚙️ Automatic test using our datasets
Alternatively, you can test the aligner using our predefined synthetic datasets with the following Python script:

```bash
python scripts/run_poagpu.py <num_blocks> <num_vertici> <num_reads> <len_reads> [--example]
```
Arguments:

- `<num_blocks>`: number of CUDA blocks to use

- `<num_vertici>`: number of vertices in the graph (as indicated in the filename)

- `<num_reads>`: number of reads (e.g. 100, 1000, 10000 — will be auto-formatted to the find the right folder)

- `<len_reads>`: read length (as indicated in the filename)

- `--example` (optional): use example files from test/examples/ directory

This script allows you to reproduce our benchmarks or run structured tests with minimal manual setup.
